# Modded-Daily-Dose-Of-Malware-
This is the DDoM script, but it lets you choose how many files you want to download. 
Check the README file for information on how to use it. 
I am NOT responsible for any damage done to your system with this tool.

You must install selenium and pvvirtualdisplay by running this in powershell:
"pip install selenium"
"pip install pyvirtualdisplay"

You can also use this for Malcode:
"pip install bs4"

You also need geckodriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

That's pretty much it. This tool was originally created by Enderman.
